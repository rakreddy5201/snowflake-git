        üí° **Tips**
        - `MATERIALIZED VIEW`s are beneficial when the query results are relatively small compared to the base table, contain data requiring extensive processing, or involve external tables with slower performance.
        - Choose to create a `MATERIALIZED VIEW` when *query results are stable*, *used frequently*, and *resource-intensive*, or when saving processing time, and storage costs matter.
        - Opt for a regular `VIEW` when query results change often, aren't frequently used, or the query is not resource-intensive, and it's not costly to re-run.
        - Creating a `MATERIALIZED VIEW` incurs costs, and the decision to use them should be evaluated against the potential performance gains.
        - `MATERIALIZED VIEW`s are limited to querying a single table and cannot support `JOIN`s, including self-`JOIN`s. They are also unable to query `MATERIALIZED VIEW`s, regular `VIEW`s, or user-defined `FUNCTION`s (`UDF`). See the full list of limitations [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/views-materialized).
