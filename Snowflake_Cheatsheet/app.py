                    However you like! 🤷🏻

                    But here's my recommendation:

                    In a typical Snowflake work session, you might find yourself juggling various commands such as 
                    cloning a database and schema, creating new tables or views, rummaging through files on a stage, keeping tabs on Snowpipe, wrangling data through manual copying, insertion, or updating, etc, etc ... the list is long!

                    Now, keeping the precise syntax of all these commands at your fingertips, especially for the less-frequently-used ones, can be quite a challenge. 
                    I recommend keeping this cheat sheet open in a tab while you work. This way, you can swiftly refer to the provided code snippets and easily adapt them to your specific tasks. 
                    To keep things streamlit 🎈... sorry, I mean streamlined, I have removed options and arguments that are not frequently used in each command. 
                    However, keep in mind that I have cherry-picked the options based on my personal workflow experience which may not necessarily align with yours.     

                    Within each segment, there's a special treat ❄️: a bonus section with top tips to elevate your Snowflake skills.  
                    I suggest that whenever you are using a command for the first time, spend a few minutes reading the tips and hopefully pick up something new.

This guide is limited in scope and offers just a glimpse into the expansive array of Snowflake's *cool* features—pun intended. 
The reason for this is threefold:  
1. Time is finite, as suggested by modern physics. 
2. Snowflake is breaking the laws of physics by adding features faster than the speed of light, making it impossible for any mortal to catch up.
3. I am a mortal.

But here's where you come in, my knowledgeable friend. You likely have insights, cool features, or corrections that could benefit the entire Snowflake community. 
As an open-source project, I warmly (or should I say coolly? 🤔) welcome and eagerly look forward to your invaluable contribution.
